# django-crud
A simple CRUD written in Django (Python) 


This simple project was made during a Lab session @ DIO (https://digitalinnovation.one) after I finished their Fullstack Bootcamp where I did a Python Course and got interested to know more.
It is about a CRUD developed with Django 3.1 and Python 3.8.
