# django-crud
A simple CRUD written in Django (Python)


This simple project was made during a Lab session @ DIO (https://digitalinnovation.one) after I finished their Fullstack Bootcamp where I did a Python Course and got interested to know more.
It is about a CRUD developed with Django 3.1 and Python 3.8. It has been deployed at Heroku.
